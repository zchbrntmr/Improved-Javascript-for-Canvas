Improved-Javascript-for-Canvas
==============================

Added new functions and some improved syntax to make it much easier to draw graphics on the HTML canvas element.  For the code to work correctly, either import it using a script tag or place the code inside the script tag that you will be using.  Make sure that your script is located after the canvas element and also that the canvas element has the id "canvas" in order for it to work properly.
